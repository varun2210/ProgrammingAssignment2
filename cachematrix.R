## The following pair of functions cache the inverse of a matrix.
##
## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
##
## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then cacheSolve retrieves the inverse from the cache.

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", 
## which is really a list containing a function to
##
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inv) inv <<- inv
  getinv <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}

## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse 
## in the cache via the setinv function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(inv)
  inv
}
